BEGIN EXAMPLES
Let's start with a couple examples to get you started. Below, we have coded two
custom types: `Cylinder` and `Car`. They are not meant to be used or invoked.
They are simply here as a place to make some sensible documentation.
*/

///  Each and every custom type that you write into a smart contract, must be
///  annotated with the `contracttype` macro. This generates conversions from
///  the created type from/into a `RawVal` Soroban can use.
#[contracttype]
// Here we create a `Cylinder` type as an example. We use the `struct` keyword
// to define the type, which allows us to structure together multiple related
// values. Inside the struct, we create the `fields` that will describe an
// instance of the `Cylinder` type. A `field` is made up of a name (`radius`)
// paired with a type the associated value must conform to (`u32`).
pub struct Cylinder {
    pub radius: u32,
    pub height: u32,
}

/// Our example `Car` type is created using the `enum` keyword. Enums allow you
/// to define a custom type by listing its possible variants. In this case, any
/// instance of `Car` could be manufactured by `Ford`, `Honda`, `Porsche`, etc.
#[contracttype]
pub enum Car {
    Chevrolet,
    Ford,
    Mercedes,
    Porsche,
    Honda,
    Toyota,
}

END EXAMPLES
We're going to turn you loose now! Below, each of the custom types need to
be completed before you deploy and invoke your contract. If you have any
questions during this part of the task, you should *really* check out the
"Custom Types" article that's linked in the README.
